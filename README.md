Simple React App
================
Super simple. Kinda based on the app found here:

http://survivejs.com/webpack_react/webpack_and_react/

But I also set up the React Hot Loader found here:
 
http://gaearon.github.io/react-hot-loader/

Instructions
------------
Clone the repo. Then `npm install`, then `npm start`. No Gulpfile. Runs entirely through npm and webpack.
